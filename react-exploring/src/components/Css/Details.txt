Flexbox is good for one direction code ( one dimentional)
helps to arrange the elements easily ( flexible)
control spacing alignment and order of elements.

Terminology - 
    Flex container - parent 
    Flex items - childrens

    Axis - main axis - left to right
           cross axis - top to bottom


         -------------------  <-- cross start
        |                   |
        |   item 1, 2, 3    |    Cross Size
        |                   |
        |-------------------| <--- cross end
 (main start) main size (main end)

 Proprties associated with Flex container - 
    display - flex ( take all the width -block ) /inline-flex( take the size equal to elements - inline)
    flex-direction - ( sets the dorection of main axis)
        main access by default left to right. ( row, row-reverse ) column - item flows from top to bottom, column-reverse
    flex-wrap - controles wrapping of flex items within the container
       no-wrap - default ( when shrinked item shrink to some extends and then horizontal row), wrap - to wrap within the container ( when shrinked move to next row)
       wrap-reverse - when shrinked last item goes above
    flex-flow - shorthand for flex direction and flex wrap
       flex-flow - row no-wrap ( default )
    column-gap - sets the gap between columns
       column-gap:20px
    row-gap - sets the gap between row
    gap - shorthand for row-gap and column gap
       gap:10px 20px
    justify-content - aligns items in main-acess and disrtibute extra spaces in between
       flex-start ( default ), flex-end ( main end), centre,
       space-between ( space is evenly distributed in items)
       space-around ( space is added in start and end along with in between)
       space-evenly ( )
    align-items - align item accross the cross axis
        stretch ( to fill the container)
       flex-start - push the item to start of container
       flex-end - push the item to bottom of container
       centre - and baseline - text baseline
    align-content - align rows of content move across cross axis
       flex-start - 
       space-between - 
       space-around - 
       

Flex item properties - 
       order - 1 will shift to end ( 0 by default of all)
       flex-grow - what amount of space it should take inside the item
              0 - default( no grow ), 1 - will take up all the remaining space 
       flex-shrink - ability to shrink item if necessary, relative to other items in the container
              1 - defualt value, 0 - no shrink
              2,3 -  they will shrink more than other items
       flex-basis - initial size of flex item ( width property)
              auto - default 200px 
              flex grow and flex shrink apply on top of flex basis
       flex - shorthand for above <grow><shrink><basis>
       align self - alignment of individual items acors cross axis
              flex-start, flex-end, centre
